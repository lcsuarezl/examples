My daughter is currently learning addition at school.
She sometimes gets things wrong when summing up two digits

Given the two initial numbers and her calculated result, you have to check if it is correct

>if yest, output the string "OK"
>if no, return the digit index on where she got it wrong (converted to a string)
Unit digit has the index "0" tens digit has the index "1" . etc

She just began to learn addition, so there is no carry in any digit of all the numbers she has to sum up

Al the numbers have a maximum of 5 digits, but the two initial numbers and the result may not have the same number of digits

Example:

The two initial values are 123 and 672. Her calculated result is 785

>Unit digit check: 3 + 2 = 5. ok
>Tens digit check: 2 + 7 = 9, but my daughter wrote 8. it's wrong
>Hundreds digit check: 1 + 6 = 7. ok

You must output "1", which is the index of the tens digit.
