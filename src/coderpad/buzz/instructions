Write the body of the fizzBuzz(number, map) method

number is an integer and map is a non-null map

The fizzBuzz method should return a string. This string is the concatenation
of map's values associated with the keys that are divisors of the number parameter
(in divisors ascending order)

if no key in map can divide number, the method should return number as a string.

Constraint: 1<= number <= 100
